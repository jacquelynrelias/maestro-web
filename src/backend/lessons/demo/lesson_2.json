      "text": "A slight addition to the note tree is the concept of “dotting.” When you put a dot after a note, you add half its duration to the beat value. Therefore, dotting a quarter note adds an eighth note to it. A dotted whole note is a whole note plus a half note. You take the value of the next beat down on the beat tree and add it.",

      "text": "Just as there are beats to denote the sound of a note, there must be a symbol for the absence of music, or a “rest.” A rest means no notes are played, and it follows its own tree. A good way to remember a whole rest versus a half rest is “a whole (full) gentleman takes his hat off, whereas only half a gentleman keeps his hat on his head.” Or a hole goes in the ground (the whole rest block goes below the line).",
